# Longan Nano BME280 SPI Example

This is the result of me trying to understand longan nano spi used with a sensor.

It contains various examples that should be reusable in other code
* Serial output with printf()
* Using RGB LED of Longan Nano
* Read onchip temperature and reference voltage
* Init SPI
* Use BME280 sensor driver from Bosch with SPI
* Use 160x80 OLED SPI LCD

why do you [find valuable resources](https://github.com/MuellerA/LonganNanoTest/tree/master/SpiDma/src) only after it is too late. Ok I2C will be easier now :)
